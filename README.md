Implement an Advanced Branching Strategy steps:
I create a new feature branch named backend from the develop branch. 
Then I made a project and committed it to the backend branch and also switch back to the develop branch and merge the changes from the feature branch. 
Furthremore, I created a release branch from the main branch named 'release/0.1.0.' Then simulate bug fixes or last-minute features and commit them. And also switch back to the main branch and merge the changes from the release branch. 
So, everything is update now.
